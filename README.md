Machine Learning codes for Health Data analysis, PLATON.

The following codes were used for biomedical research, applying machine Learning Techniques with Data Analysis purpose.

The file "Preprocesado_clustering.R" is a R script that follows the next Pipeline: EDA, Preprocessing, Clustering, Clustering validation measures.
The file "Analisis_cluster.R" is a R script thatanalyze differencer between clusters in the input features.
The file "Analisis_cluster_2.R" is a R script thatextract difference between clusters inno input features, also extract Kaplan-Meier survival curves.
The file  "m_predictivos_medas_v.1.1.ipnyb" is a Jupyter Notebook in Python that applies predictive models, following the pipeline: Feature selection  (6 methods), machine learning algorithms and validation using cross-validation, machine learning algorithms and validation using cross-validation and hyperparameter search, SHAP values and plotting.
The file "Regresion_logistica" is a R script that perform logistic regressions witha test and a training set, also multinomial, and extract some validation measures.
